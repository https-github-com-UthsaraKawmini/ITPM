With the advent of the coronavirus, everything became virtual. So it's very risky for people to come to the gym
 in such a dangerous environment. Also, at that time people are trapped at home which is so adverse to human
 lives. No healthy activities for their lives. Spreader non-communicable diseases and make their body grew big.
 so this bad time we have to care more than anything about our health. So the solution is to use a virtual gym
 for exercise. It gives people the feeling of being in a class with an instructor in the comfort of their own home. 
It also saves time.
